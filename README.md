# Leaflet-Challenge

This project utilized Leaflet to map earthquake data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) of earthquakes with a 2.5 magnitude or above that occurred within the past 30 days. Markers for each earthquake include a pop-up box which describe the magnitude, depth, location, and the date and time of the earthquake.

The markers increase in size with increasing magnitude. The color of the marker corresponds to the depth of the earthquake.
